\section{Progress to Date}
As set forth in our initial proposal, we continue to view the dependency
detection algorithm as decoupled from the delta-debugging
algorithm. Accordingly, our work to date has emphasized the dependency detection
aspect of the project and this midpoint review will detail our progress on that
section.

The \emph{front-end} (responsible for parsing source files and generating
semantic dependencies between source ranges) is the source of most of the
progress that we have made. Given the need to intelligently walk the AST, we
have extended the C/C++ front-end of Clang to introduce our syntactic and
semantic dependency constrains over \emph{source ranges}. As anticipated, we
have encountered some minor source range issues in Clang that required
additional character-level parsing, but by-and-large the existing AST has
provided the majority of the required information.

Thus far, we have encountered a few minor issues during development but these were
anticipated in the initial project proposal. As there was a proof-of-concept
program sketch made last summer, we knew that the source ranges reported by
Clang \citep{clang} sometimes does not encompass what one would expect. For
example, the source range of a \emph{typedef} declaration statement (that is, a
TypedefDecl node) does not include the initial "typedef" keyword nor does it
extend to the trailing semicolon. To address this, we implemented a few helper
functions to generate "true" source ranges for these few special cases. As we
had anticipated encountering these kinds of issues, when they arose we were able
to handle them in time and have remained on schedule.

Our output from the Constraint Generation phase is a flat-file representing the
both the mapping from symbols (statements/functions/etc.) to
source-ranges and the dependencies between symbols. We record this information in
the form of Prolog predicates that will feed directly into the next project phase.


Thus far, we have developed the following components of our front-end:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\emph{Driver} - initializes and envokes the diagnostic components}

\item{\emph{StmtVisitor} - visits Stmt objects (the Clang representation
  of statements/expressions) and creates dependencies between a statement and
  the declaration of the variables referenced therein.}

\item{\emph{ConstraintGenerator} - visits the top-level variable, function and
  type declarations (typedefs) and generates appropriate dependencies. Also
  is responsible for instantiating a fresh statement visitor to visit the body
  of each of the top level functions.}

\item{\emph{Helper functions} - Clang doesn't quite give us the source ranges we
  want for the various lexical elements so we have added helper functions
  to scan forward/backward in the source file. There are also helper methods in
  place responsible for printing out the Prolog predicates encapsulating source
  range information and dependencies between various elements.
\end{itemize}

The visitors, which represent the majority of the complexity at this stage of
the project, are largely complete. We have a full-featured declaration-level
dependency generator that handles \emph{typedef}, \emph{enum}, \emph{struct},
\emph{global variable}, and \emph{function} declaration related
dependencies. Within the function declaration dependency generator, our
statement-level visitor traverses the statements and expressions within the
function scope. This statement-level visitor currently handles \emph{variable}
dependencies and appropriately resolves the \emph{scope} of dependencies as
well.

We've also started tackling some of the more important C++ constructs and have
dependency-generating visitors in place for \emph{function templates} and
\emph{template specialization}. We're currently working on handling
\emph{friendship} and \emph{inheritance} related \emph{class} dependencies. While
not complete for all language features to date, we anticipate finishing the
Constraint Generation phase of the project for most of the important constructs
by our 11/12 deadline.


\section{Future Developments}

Our next project phase, the Querying Framework, will involve the design and
implementation of the search and querying strategy. Encapsulating the dependency
information in the form of Prolog predicates means that things like computing
the transitive closure of the dependency relation will be trivial. Over the
course of the next few weeks, we will consider possible search strategies and
how they might be implemented. We will also consider whether there would be any
benefit in going to a graph based representation whereby we might be able to
make use algorithms from graph cutting. For this next phase of the project we
plan on working with PySWIP \citep{pyswip} which provides a bridge between
Python and SWI-Prolog. Finally, we have begun looking at test cases for use in
the evaluate phase. By beginning to look at the test cases now, we're ensuring
that we implement the necessary components in the Constraint Generation phase.
While the methodology we're exploring could theoreticall work with any constraints,
we intend to provide as accurate of a respresentation of our ideas as we can given
the types of dependencies we see in what should be representative test cases.
